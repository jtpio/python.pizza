                    <p>
                        <b>Python Pizza</b> is a micro conference organized by the Python Berlin Community.

                        <br />
                        We bring the Python Community together for some amazing original Pizzaâ„¢ and Python Talks.

                        <br />
                        We believe in and encourage practical sessions, in which developers share their experience and lessons from real-world projects, each talk is 10 mins long.

                        <br />
                        Thanks to the Python Pizza (Naples!) that started this format!
